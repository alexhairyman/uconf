## # style comments

## I kinda liked lighttpd's configuration style, so here is something similar

# strings /should/ be formatted with "strgoes here", but I'm not totally decided on enforcing that yet


#you don't technically have to use {}, it just makes it easier
root
{
  name = "root"
}

root.alex@name = "alexroot"
root.alex@age = 16 #integer

root.alex
{
  str = "alex"
  inalex = TRUE #bool
}

root.alex.mysec
{
  name = "mysection"
  blah = "bleh"
  compressors = ("bz2", "gz", "xz") #this will probably be a vector, notice, () is list, while... ( see below )
  switches = [DEBUG = TRUE, USEBOOST = FALSE, THREADS = 3, PREFIX = "/usr/local"] # [] is a dictionary
}

root.newname = newroot # changing a variable in root
root.alex.newname = newalexroot # changing root.alex.newname
root.alex = blah # BAD BAD BAD BAD
